### Ko wai au? Who am I?

Ko Ng훮ti P훮keh훮 te iwi, ko Rangiora whenua tupu, ko Natalie Forsdick ahau. 

I'm a New Zealander hailing from Rangiora. I completed my PhD at the University of Otago in 2020.

I am now a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Manaaki Whenua -- Landcare Research](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/) in T훮maki Makaurau (Auckland), Aotearoa New Zealand. My research is part of the [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/) High Quality Genomes project. Through this project, I am currently focussed on sequencing and assembling high quality genomes for a range of endemic taxa. The purpose of this research is to understand the evolutionary history and genomic characteristics of endemic species, often through a conservation genomics lens. I have the pleasure of working with smart and kind people across a wide variety of organisations and communities. 

Along with research, I am interested in building communities, and this has led to my involvement in various societies. I take great pride in representing [Birds New Zealand](https://www.birdsnz.org.nz) as Vice-President, and in my role as Secretary for the [Society for Conservation Biology Oceania region](https://scboceania.org). I also co-lead Manaaki Whenua's Early Career Group, and informally co-chair the Genomics Aotearoa HQG Postdoc Group. In my free time, you can often find me out and about with my trusty binoculars or bird-watching scope.
